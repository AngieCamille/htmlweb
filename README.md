# htmlweb - WHTC

updated:

whtc/home folder is the most up to date.
html3 folder is outdated but can be used as backup incase of errors.

- Quick link buttons are not complete, please modify them.
- Testimonial codes were giving trouble integrating with the main codes. Please fix if possible.
- As stated in the last readme update, the enquiry form will go on a different page if it keeps giving trouble going on the home footer.
